\chapter{Complex systems theory on adaptation and evolution (II)}


\section{Complex systems in theoretical biology}
% in here just describe the interactions between agents

\subsection{Biological interactions}
\subsubsection{Biochemical pathways of secondary metabolites}
% look up those systems that are necessary for secondary metabolites
% in plants, since they may be useful in writing defense mechanisms
\subsubsection{Developmental biology and epigenetic landscape}
% there is quite an extensive lit on the epi landscape apparently
% there are two in the "Complexity" folder and one in Firefox
% these two complex systems should be enough

\subsection{Ecological interactions}
% look up complex systems in higher scales
% do not yet focus on the problems, but rather on how they interact
% most of the work has been summarized in Dong2019
\subsubsection{Population ecology}
\subsubsection{Community ecology}

Anthropogenic interactions (human interventions) and their consequences, while considered as community ecological interactions, will be discussed in the last chapter of the reports.

\section{Chaos and self-organization in real systems}
% in here describe how interactions will lead to self-organization
% towards asymptotic ideals (?)

\subsection{Self-organization in chaotic systems}
\subsection{Self-organization in physical systems}
\subsection{Self-organization in ecological systems}

\section{Influences of self-organization on adaptation and evolution}
From the exposition of biological and ecological interactions between different agents in different
