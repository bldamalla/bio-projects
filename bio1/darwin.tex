\chapter{Post-Darwin evidences of natural selection and evolution (I)}

%% some doubts about natural selection \cite{Ridley}
The role of the notion of epigenetics in the Modern Synthesis \cite{Baedke2013, Goldberg2007} was introduced in the first chapter on complexity.
But the study of epigenetics is only a small part relative to the more prominent results from \emph{Mendelian genetics}, discussed in the previous chapter, and Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection \cite{Ridley}.
Darwin's work \textit{On the Origin of Species} was very important in the unification of concepts in biology \cite{biomain}.
Though there were some objections to his theory, as will be discussed in light of arguments from \citeA{Ridley} and \citeA{biomain}, most of biology is still \textit{unified through evolution} \cite{Ridley}.

\section{Evidences of ``natural selection'' and evolution}
%% these will just be historical accounts on the development
%% there are a lot enumerated in the book
%% try to discuss them here

Since it has been exposed that complexity is ubiquitous is biology, especially in dealing with different scales of organization, evidences towards natural selection should be present in the scales of interest.
In this section, complex molecular (HIV evolution) and community (melanism and artificial selection) interactions and their effects on the complex systems are discussed.

\subsection{HIV evolution and natural selection} % Ridley
\subsection{Industrial melanism} % Main
\subsection{Artifical selection} % Ridley and Main
\subsection{Homologous structures} % Ridley

\section{Critiques against natural selection}
%% there are also things in the book about this -- Main

\section{The Modern Synthesis}
%% cite Ridley for a summary of general characteristics of nat sel
%% and the Modern synthesis
%% there will probably be new concepts on genetic drift et al
%% epigenetics probably further the complications

\section{Complexity behind selection}
At this point, it can be summarized that natural selection is a solid mechanism to explain evolution.
