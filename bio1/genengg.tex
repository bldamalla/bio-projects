\section{\textalpha -1-antitrypsin and the deficiency}
\subsection{\textalpha -1-antitrypsin (AAT)}
%% blablabla protein synthesized in liver cells
%% controlled by two alleles on chromosome 14

\subsection{The deficiency AATD}
%% gene abnormality
%% kinds of mutations involved
%% main mutation and effects
%%% point mutation causing change of amino acid Glu to Lys
%%% cause reduction in binding of a protein
%%% change in protein charge affecting cell and plasma balance
%%% destabilization of AAT (polymerization) and failure of secretion

\section{Therapies}
\subsection{Augmentation therapy}
%% deficiency can cause emphysema, reasonable to replenism
%% testing for severity of deficiency was found to be impractical so
%% biochem treatment is sufficient
%% it effectively normalizes lung plasma AAT

\subsection{Gene and stem cell therapy}
%% classical form of gene therapy

%% studies on such
%%% use of viral vectors to transfer genetic material
%%%% adeno-associated viral vectors blabla
%%% routes of administration
%%%% liver (portal vein), airway, intramuscular

%% stem cell used for gene delivery (gene injection to bone marrow)
